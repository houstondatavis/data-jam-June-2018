# Instructions for using the Kepler_Water_datajam.json to open the map in <a href="https://uber.github.io/kepler.gl/">Keplergl</a>.

1. Go to https://uber.github.io/kepler.gl/#/demo
2. Click the add your own files button. Select the Kepler_Water_datajam.json in the same folder as this mardown file.
3. Get the same map as shown in the photos below. Play around with settings window to change appearance.
